make content widget configuration more flexible, and avoid having to create a large number of widgets with static configurations, we are starting to support content configuration placeholders. Placeholders can have a substantial impact on performance and hardware requirements, so we will introduce support for specific fields over time in a controlled fashion to avoid operational issues. \r\n\r\nInitially, we want to support the ability to submit key-values from a content widget tag to be replaced in the content configuration \"query\" and \"filter\" fields.\r\n\r\nA placeholder has the general syntax:\t\r\n{code}\r\n{<source>:<key>|<default>}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n* The <source> field defines where <key> comes from. Initially, we will support \"parameter\" (values coming from the widget tag). Later, we will introduce “content” for values from the content profile, “user” for values from the user profile, and “event” for value from the current event, but this is not part of this ticket.\r\n* The <key> field defines the key we use for the replacement, i.e., the placeholder is replaced with the value associated with <key>.\r\n* The symbols {noformat} { } : | {noformat} cannot appear in <source>, <key> or <default>.\r\n* The <default> value kicks in if the <source>:<key> for some reason is invalid or otherwise cannot be evaluated.\r\n* There can be multiple placeholders in the same query or filter field\r\n\r\nExample: \r\n{code}\r\n\"filter\": \"filter(category:\\\"{parameter:productcategory|electronics}\\\")\"\r\n\"query\": \"query(title:\\\"{parameter:userquery|*}\\\")\"\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThese placeholders will be supported for the type \"recs\" with matching modes: \"trend\", \"contextual\", \"behavioral\", \"collabctx\", \"collabusr\", and \"explicit\"\r\n\r\nThe placeholder key-values are submitted from the widget tag using the context object, see example below:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n{ context: { parameters: { category:'cameras', userquery:'sony' } } }\r\n{code}","customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_10040":["PM-2016-H2","product_roadmap"],"customfield_10658":null,"issuelinks":[{"id":"27958","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issueLink/27958","type":{"id":"10002","name":"Depends","inward":"is

was in the beginning two completly static views and has since been patched and modified to add functionality. This is mainly been done by adding support for user flexibility using the same building blocks that were created in the beginning. This has for the most part been a success story but we are now seeing the \"final\" limitations of the code. We see this primarily in two places.\r\n\r\n1. It is very difficult to create widgets that have non-trivial, multiple request (possibly with inter query dependencies). Evidence of this is the amount of time it took to create the Segment widget, Funnel Widget and Document widget. Creating more of these complex widgets won't take any less time if the building blocks aren't changed.\r\n2. Complex widgets, large workspaces are slow. The root cause of this is that there is a lot of stuff happening in the background (like network request state change) that will result on a complete re-render of the widget/workspaces. This is an expensive operation with our current libraries.\r\n\r\nA further (smaller) issue is that the API cache is tied to the workspace/view. This means that if you navigate from view A -> B -> A you will have to do the requests for A twice, even though the first requests are still valid. \r\n\r\nSollution:\r\nDo a complete rewrite of Workspaces using modern tools (the same tools used to create most of the DMP app).","customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_10040":["Dev-2016-H2","technical_roadmap"],"customfield_10658":null,"issuelinks":[{"id":"28017","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issueLink/28017","type":{"id":"10001","name":"Related","inward":"is

want to introduce the ability to perform impression capping making sure that a user isn't exposed to the same message/experience/output more than a preconfigured number of times.\r\n\r\nThe configuration will be based on using conditions with the following syntax:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n            {\r\n              \"type\": \"recs\",\r\n              \"condition\": {\r\n                \"type\": \"impressionCapping\", \"count\": 8, \"period\": 86400, \"capTag\" : \"subscriptionpromotion\"}\r\n                [...]\r\n              },\r\n              \"matchingMode\": {...}\r\n              },\r\n            }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n- We introduce a new condition type \"impressionCapping\".\r\n- The \"count\" and \"period\" fields are used to restrict the exposure of results. An individual user can only be exposed to results up to and including the value of \"count\" during the \"period\".\r\n- The \"period\" is measured in seconds, and the max value for period is 604800, corresponding to 7 days.\r\n- The field \"capTag\" acts as a label for the impression capping. This allows multiple branches to define impression capping tracked towards the same label.\r\n\r\nTracking of impressions must capture the combination of the user id, the time, and the \"capTag\". The impression tracking count is increased with the number of items returned.\r\n\r\nAn impression is not counted if:\r\n- The branch returns no results\r\n- The branch returns backfill\r\n\r\n ","customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_10040":["Customer-Sprint-Pri","PM-2016-H2","fromTheField","onboarding","product_roadmap"],"customfield_10658":null,"issuelinks":[{"id":"27482","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issueLink/27482","type":{"id":"10001","name":"Related","inward":"is related to","outward":"relates to","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issueLinkType/10001"},"outwardIssue":{"id":"38746","key":"PM-163","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issue/38746","fields":{"summary":"Cx Content: Impression Capping / counts in recs","status":{"self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/status/5","description":"A resolution has been taken, and it is awaiting verification by reporter.

These field names are used downstream by applications (in particular Cxense Content) that assume certain names for those fields.\r\n\r\nThe overall requirement is that the downstream applications (in particular Cxense Content) should not care about if the document was crawled or pushed via /document/update: So if I push a document, I should be able to controllably populate a field in the search index that would have been populated if the document was crawled.\r\n\r\nSome comments on the phrase \"controllably populate a field\":\r\n\r\n* When a document is crawled, the phantomjs-based crawling subsystem by default creates some image-data fields in the search index, e.g., \\{\"dominantimage\", \"thumbnail\", \"thumbnailfullheightdimension\", ...\\}. It should be possible to specify these also when pushing, but in that case it's the pusher's responsibility that the pushed values for image URLs/dimension are valid. (This means that it's OK to push in image URLs that reside on servers outside of Cxense's own infrastructure.)\r\n* When a crawled document's text (and the document's URL) is processed, the content processing subsystem produces a number of \"prefixless\" fields in the content profile, e.g., \\{\"category\", \"taxonomy\", \"person\", \"concept\", \"company\", \"location\", ...\\}. (In the search index, some of these for historical reasons end up in the search index as \\{\"kw-person\", \"kw-concept\", \"kw-company\", \"kw-location\", ...\\}.) It should be possible to specify the values of these explicitly when pushing. E.g., if \"person\" is explicitly specified, this overrides whatever we'd infer from the title and body fields using the built-in entity extraction logic. Since we want to have control over the \"prefixless\" fields and the empty namespace, it's OK if this happens via a whitelist.\r\n* When crawling an HTML document, the document can contain <meta> tags whose content end up in the search index. All of these, too, should be allowed to specify explicitly when pushing. In particular, the \"og-\" and \"recs-\" prefixes are in a sense special and reserved for this, and are not ordinary customer-prefixes and we make special exceptions for these. E.g., if I via crawling and <meta> fields can have a field created in the search index named \"recs-boogaboo\", then I should be able to do this via pushing, too. Note that \"recs-\" and \"og-\" stuff only end up in the search index and not in the content profiles.","customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_10040":["PM-2016-H2","product_roadmap"],"customfield_10658":null,"issuelinks":[{"id":"27011","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issueLink/27011","type":{"id":"10001","name":"Related","inward":"is related to","outward":"relates to","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issueLinkType/10001"},"outwardIssue":{"id":"35727","key":"CXANA-4750","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issue/35727","fields":{"summary":"/document/update: Support natively submitting people names","status":{"self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/status/5","description":"A resolution has been taken, and it is awaiting verification by reporter.

that will be supported is:\r\n1. Bulk page view data export for all users with a Cxense user ID, for a given Cxense DMP customer, that consists of:\r\n       .serverTime (==> UNIX epoch)\r\n       .ckp (==> Cxense ID)\r\n       .ip (==> IP address)\r\n       .location (==>  URL)\r\n       .agent (==>  user agent)\r\nAny other page view data parameters for user sessions that can be exported alongside the list above is considered a bonus, but not required for external segment modeling\r\n2. Create segments offline in a 3rd party environment based on evaluating page view data (commonly referred to as 'click-stream') for the entire audience population with a Cxense ID marker\r\n3. Bulk import of externally created segments with a set of Cxense user IDs\r\n\r\nMore details in the related stories.\r\n\r\nThe work will probably include\r\na) Extension of existing event export aPI with new User ID\r\nb) implement concept of \"external segment\"\r\nc) API to create, delete, and update external segments\r\nd) UX updates to show and interact (= report and delete) external segments\r\n\r\nEven more details:\r\n\r\nWe need a mechanism for bulk import of offline generated segments with Cxense user IDs.\r\n\r\nYou need to provide meta data about a segment when it is created through the API (siteGroupId, name, optionally description, annotations, and active status), so that the segment becomes visible in the DMP segment UI. Instead of the segment being defined as filters, the segment is defined by an explicit set of Cxense user ID sent in through the API. (You must be able to use the same Cxense user ID as the one exposed through traffic/data, as well as external IDs.)\r\n\r\nThe offline segments should be able to contain at least 10 M users. One should be able to use the segment for targeting purposes within 1h after upload.\r\n\r\nThe segment will always contain the initial set of users, until the list of users is updated through the API. That is, the segment is not relevant for periodic tagging. Notwithstanding the above, the segment will organically decay in size with time, unless updated, as some Cxense user ID markers are lost with time. In other words, the \"external segment's\" size is not static, although it should be treated as a static user parameter within Cxense (not subject for periodic tagging).\r\n\r\nOne implementation option is to add an optional list of Cxense user IDs to the /segment/create and /segment/update APIs. You should also be able to read the list of user IDs for the segment through /segment/read. You cannot edit/modify filters for these segments.\r\n\r\nThe segment should behave like other segments when it is used in other APIs, like a filter for traffic queries or getting the list of segments for a user through /profile/user/segment.\r\n","customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_10040":["PM-2016-H1","PM-Sprint-Pri","product_roadmap"],"customfield_10658":null,"issuelinks":[{"id":"26045","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issueLink/26045","type":{"id":"10210","name":"Cloners","inward":"Is Cloned By","outward":"Clones","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issueLinkType/10210"},"outwardIssue":{"id":"36936","key":"CXANA-5086","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issue/36936","fields":{"summary":"Bulk import of offline segments with Cxense user IDs","status":{"self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/status/6","description":"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

These can be prioritized separately. Closing this ticket.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nBased on today's meeting, we have decided on the following:\r\n\r\n1. We use the exisiting articleId field for document/update. Will need to extend the format to allow non-numeric characters. This will make it more prone to problems caused by accidental text processing. We should make sure that \"car\" and \"cars\" becomes two different IDs. \r\n2. Erik B mentioned that there is an existing meta tag we can used to represent articleId without referring to \"recs\" in the tag. \"cxenseparse:articleid\" needs to be documented, and we can probably remove the documentation for \"cxenseparse:recs:articleid\".\r\n3. For DMP push, we use a convention where our customers can send in a customer parameter with the name articleId to target a document for the DMP event. We need to make sure that a customer parameter can hold at least 40 characters. If 40 characters already is supported, no change is needed.\r\n4. Cx.js sendEvent already supports sending customer parameters. No change needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen a DMP event occurs on the same page as a document, the DMP event is automatically associated with the page view event. There are however many cases where a DMP event related to a document occurs on a different page than the document. \r\n\r\nFor instance, an \"AddToCart\" event for a Camera product can occur on a Cameras category page (instead of the details page for the product). A \"Buy\" event for a product can occur on the shopping cart page. In these cases, you need to associate the DMP event with a document ID.\r\n\r\nCustomers would want to use their own ID for the document (such as a product SKU or a video asset ID). The URL of the document is often not available when sending the DMP event.\r\n\r\nOne way to associate a DMP event with Documents would be to introduce a new documentId field for both document/update and dmp/push. When a customer push documents, they add their own documentId for the document. (You must be able to add the same documentId as meta tags when the document is crawled). When the customer push DMP events related to a document, they add the documentId in the DMP event.\r\n\r\nThere are several customer scenarios depending on this feature (flexible document widget, recommendations based on performance events, video recommendations).\r\n\r\nIn summary, here are the tasks I think are needed to solve the requirement:\r\n\r\n1. Agree on a field to use as an external document reference in document/update (could be articleId or a new field) The field is intended to support the customer id \"as-is\". Max field length can be set to 40 characters, and we need to avoid character restrictions that block common id formats.\r\n2. Agree on the meta tag used for marking up this field when the document is crawled (could be existing articleId markup or new tag)\r\n3. Add a corresponding field to dmp/push. Using customer parameters is not an option, since this document reference will be a central concept used in the UIs and across several APIs.\r\n4. Modify cx.js sendEvent method to support the new field when doing dmp/push from the browser\r\n","customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_10040":["product_roadmap"],"customfield_10658":null,"issuelinks":[{"id":"26465","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issueLink/26465","type":{"id":"10003","name":"Blocks","inward":"is

We might want to split this into multiple more fine-grained tickets.]\r\n\r\nGoogle is trying to introduce their Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) proposal as a standard on the (mobile) web:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ampproject.org/\r\n\r\nBasically, sites that follow the AMP standard will rank higher in Google searches. It's not obvious that publishers benefit from this as AMP severely constrains the type of scripts that can be run on a page, but the sentiment seems to be that one \"must\" be AMP-compliant going forwards. Hence, we need to ensure that Cxense can be deployed on a publisher's site in a fully AMP-compliant manner. Since the AMP standard constrains where and how JavaScript can be executed on a page, this has implications on us and the recommended/traditional approach with cx.js.\r\n\r\nFor getting basic event data into Cxense Insight, we have published a recipe:\r\n\r\nhttps://wiki.cxense.com/display/cust/Accelerated+Mobile+Pages+%28AMP%29+integration\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of loose ends, though:\r\n\r\n* Not all features we support with cx.js are available when following the AMP recipe, e.g., capturing active reading time and probably other things as well. This needs to be documented.\r\n* With the amp-analytics approach, the crawler is currently not able to pick up the site identifier. This will cause site validation to fail, and necessitates a manual override.\r\n* For the Cxense Insight AMP-compliance, we might want/need to provide a richer and better recipe. For example, instead of using the vanilla amp-analytics extension we might want/need to partner with Google to develop a specific amp-cxense extension, or specialized ways to use the amp-analytics extension.

By supporting recommendations based on performance events (actions), we open up to support a wide range of useful and precise recommendation scenarios. These include common collaborative filtering scenarios that are important for video, retail, and marketing use cases.\r\n\r\nSee below for example configurations. \r\n\r\n- The source event and destination event are DMP event types. \r\n- The source and destination filters are operating on the customer parameters of the DMP event. Multiple filters are treated as AND.\r\n- The \"identityparameter\" field defines the DMP event custom parameter that represents the ID of the document\r\n- The \"identityfield\" field defines which document field matches the \"identity\" values from the DMP event\r\n\r\nThe source and destination filter fields need to support placeholders.\r\n\r\nExample 1 - People who viewed (where view is a DMP event type) product with ID 26554634, ended up buying these products from category cameras:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"recs\",\r\n  \"siteIds\": [\r\n    \"12345\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"matchingMode\": {\r\n    \"actions\": {      \r\n      \"weight\": 1,\r\n      \"sourceevent\" : \"view\",\r\n      \"sourcefilter\" : [ \"sku\" : \"26554634\" ],\r\n      \"destinationevent\" : \"buy\",\r\n      \"destinationfilter\" : [ \"category\" : \"cameras\" ],\r\n      \"identityparameter\" : \"sku\",\r\n      \"identityfield\" : \"articleid\",\r\n      \"period\" : 86400\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nExample 2 - People who bought a Samsung camera ended up buying these lenses:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"recs\",\r\n  \"siteIds\": [\r\n    \"12345\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"matchingMode\": {\r\n    \"actions\": {      \r\n      \"weight\": 1,\r\n      \"sourceevent\" : \"buy\",\r\n      \"sourcefilter\" : [ \"category\" : \"cameras\", \"brand\" : \"samsung\" ],\r\n      \"destinationevent\" : \"buy\",\r\n      \"destinationfilter\" : [ \"category\" : \"lenses\" ],\r\n      \"identityparameter\" : \"sku\",\r\n      \"identityfield\" : \"articleid\",\r\n      \"period\" : 86400\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nExample 3 - Top sellers from the tablet category:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"recs\",\r\n  \"siteIds\": [\r\n    \"12345\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"matchingMode\": {\r\n    \"actions\": {      \r\n      \"weight\": 1,\r\n      \"destinationevent\" : \"buy\",\r\n      \"destinationfilter\" : [ \"category\" : \"tablet\" ],\r\n      \"identityparameter\" : \"sku\",\r\n      \"identityfield\" : \"articleid\",\r\n      \"period\" : 86400\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nExample 4 - Top videos started from in the sports category:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"recs\",\r\n  \"siteIds\": [\r\n    \"12345\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"matchingMode\": {\r\n    \"actions\": {      \r\n      \"weight\": 1,\r\n      \"destinationevent\" : \"streamStart\",\r\n      \"destinationfilter\" : [ \"category\" : \"sports\" ],\r\n      \"identityparameter\" : \"guid\",\r\n      \"identityfield\" : \"cxd-guid\",\r\n      \"period\" : 86400\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nExample 5 - People who watched more than half of this video also watched these videos:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"recs\",\r\n  \"siteIds\": [\r\n    \"12345\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"matchingMode\": {\r\n    \"actions\": {      \r\n      \"weight\": 1,\r\n      \"sourceevent\" : \"percentComplete\",\r\n      \"sourcefilter\" : [

Many of these are due to badly implemented parts of the code, and can be handled by fixing the software. The remaining are usually caused by various backend services causing parts of the widget server to slow down and ultimately fail.\r\n\r\nAdding more hardware might alleviate some of these symptoms, but most of the issues would still occur.\r\n\r\nWe need to measure the amount of failures (handled in CXANA-5049), and investigate and fix the issues that are causing these failures. Specifically incorrect handling of error situations must be fixed so the system either fails quickly so failover can occur or correctly handles known error situations. Stories will be added to this epic to fix individual issues as they are found.\r\n\r\nThe task is considered complete when the measured error rate for a longer period (1-2 weeks) under normal load is below 0.1%.","customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_10040":["InitialTriage","onboarding","technical_roadmap"],"customfield_10658":null,"issuelinks":[{"id":"25241","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issueLink/25241","type":{"id":"10003","name":"Blocks","inward":"is blocked by","outward":"blocks","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issueLinkType/10003"},"inwardIssue":{"id":"36102","key":"CXANA-4832","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issue/36102","fields":{"summary":"Add basic monitoring of widgetserver service quality","status":{"self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/status/6","description":"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

There are many scenarios where customer would like to store much more user data. One example is 3rd party audience data, which could be a source for hundreds of data points that could be used for creating segments for advertising. Another scenario is capturing data CRM or Commerce data from the customer’s own business systems, using for personalization or marketing purposes. A current limitation that we need to address, is that the external user profile only allows for storing string data. Several of the scenarios require the external user profile to handle numeric data and objects.\r\n\r\nLink to OPS:\r\n\r\nhttps://wiki.cxense.com/download/attachments/21168413/OPS%20Scalable%20and%20Flexible%20External%20User%20Profiles.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1455016689982&api=v2\r\n","customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_10040":["PM-2017-H1","fromTheField","onboarding","product_roadmap"],"customfield_10658":null,"issuelinks":[{"id":"25576","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issueLink/25576","type":{"id":"10210","name":"Cloners","inward":"Is Cloned By","outward":"Clones","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issueLinkType/10210"},"outwardIssue":{"id":"29761","key":"CXANA-3290","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issue/29761","fields":{"summary":"Removal the restriction for external data","status":{"self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/status/5","description":"A resolution has been taken, and it is awaiting verification by reporter.

Or probably can you provide us access to some kind of dev stand?  It is hard for me estimate timeline for this point - but I assume that it should be relative easy - isn't it?\r\n\r\n3.1 Rebrand current Maxifier ADMAX version and logos (@Evgeny)   (should be agreed upfront with smb on CXense site ?)\r\n3.2 Release new version of ADMAX which will be use CXense SSO (@Evgeny) and deploy it into maxifier.cxense.com \r\n\r\n4.

But currently it is our of Phase 1.  So I assume that we will have only demo accounts here and common clients only. \r\nWe have a vision that current CXense users who hasn't Maxifier account - should see Demo data. (instead of empty system)\r\n  It is a bit different from current CXense strategy - but I think it can be helpfull for Demo's as well as for upsell \r\n\r\n\r\n We would like to decrese initial workload on our hardware from your current users and protect system from some anonimous newly registred users.\r\nSo we need to limit this access somehow to Maxifier ( e.g. do it on permission basis - only for big CXense clients - this list we expect re setup manually)\r\n\r\n\r\nTimeline: \r\n   My initial expectation that all this stuff can be easily done in 3-6 weeks (depends on priorities)\r\n\r\n\r\n*Phase 2*.

After they have been linked and merged, they are one user and always counted as one.\r\n\r\nThe problem occurs once a customer does something like this:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\naddExternalId(type, \"unknown\")\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nlinking more than one user to the same value, often a static string. Examples are that the identity has been set to \"undefined\" (the string), \"null\" (the string), 0 (the number) and the md5sum of 1. In all of these cases multiple users were linked to the same user, in effect making them into one big customer.\r\n\r\nThis then leads to wrong numbers in Analytics when it comes to unique users, and broken user profiles etc..\r\n\r\nAt the time of writing, it is difficult to undo this damage, and a full undo isn't possible since the data is in essence lost. After one wrong linking, all the other identifiers captured with this user is also corrupted and set to the same internal global value.\r\n\r\nFor ckp, gckp, lst and cst, this isn't a big problem, as those are not directly under user control. Even if someone tried to abuse those, it would be hard since they would have to guess the other values. Since they do not stand to gain much, this has been deemed an acceptable risk.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this epic is to reduce this risk by:\r\n\r\n1) Avoid trusting the results of addExternalId as much as we do today\r\n2) Make the external id be resolved query time, and also allow it to be deleted after the fact for when the user does something wrong\r\n3) Convert \"UniqueUsers\" back to being something like \"Unique Devices\", and stop 2) from changing the numbers. Even if the number is better (in some ways) than unique users only based on ckp/gckp/lst/cst, it makes it more difficult to compare it to Google Analytics etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n","customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_10040":["support_maintenance"],"customfield_10658":null,"issuelinks":[{"id":"22958","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issueLink/22958","type":{"id":"10001","name":"Related","inward":"is related to","outward":"relates to","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issueLinkType/10001"},"inwardIssue":{"id":"33011","key":"CXANA-4115","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issue/33011","fields":{"summary":"Handle nonexisting identities in /dmp/push","status":{"self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/status/6","description":"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

Goals\r\n\r\n - Reduce number of OOM crashes\r\n - Reduce chance of killer queries\r\n - Reduce cost of requests\r\n - Enable Customer cubes for NTM in production\r\n\r\nh2. Collections, events and keyword documents\r\n\r\nWe focus on create customer collections in the history cube server first, which is meant to replace all lts/dmp cubes and data in the global history cubes for the customer.\r\n\r\nThe following collection schema is propsed: history.<customerid>.customer\r\n\r\nThe following event types must have a list of customers attached (the rest can be ignored for now):\r\n * RepoLogEvent (the pageview analytics event)\r\n * DmpEvent\r\n * SegmentEvent (lookalike events can be filtered on)\r\n\r\nThe following container types must be written with a customer collection if it belongs to the customer:\r\n * user-external\r\n * user-offline\r\n * user-identity\r\n * content\r\n\r\nh2. Background\r\n\r\nWe want to isolate customers as much as possible from each other. For example:\r\n\r\n- Reliability - Problems with one customers should not affects other customers\r\n- Performance - Aggregation, operations and other requests only need to access data for one customer.\r\n- Security - Reduce the risk for exposing data for a customer to another customer. It's easy to delete or change data for a single customer, according to need.\r\n- Scalability - Easy to cluster similar customers together, or separate out customers witch special performance needs.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, we need to be able to identify which customer a request belongs to, and make sure all event and keyword data is sent to the correct customer environment. For events, this means we need to map a siteId to a set of customers, and for API requests we need to map a user to a customer.\r\n\r\nThe technical solution for the cube is to introduce the concept of cube collections, which acts as independent environments which shares nothing with other cube collections except for the JVM process it's running on. All data for a siteId belonging to multiple customers must be duplicated in each customer's cube collection. Clients will not be available to execute requests spanning multiple cube collections.","customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_10040":["Dev-2016-H1","MSR-Pri","technical_roadmap"],"customfield_10658":null,"issuelinks":[{"id":"26246","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issueLink/26246","type":{"id":"10003","name":"Blocks","inward":"is blocked by","outward":"blocks","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issueLinkType/10003"},"outwardIssue":{"id":"37082","key":"CXANA-5136","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issue/37082","fields":{"summary":"Customer isolation - move first wave of customers","status":{"self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/status/1","description":"The issue is open and ready for the assignee to start work on it.","iconUrl":"https://jira.cxense.com/images/icons/statuses/open.png","name":"Open","id":"1"},"priority":{"self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/priority/2","iconUrl":"https://jira.cxense.com/images/icons/priorities/critical.png","name":"Urgent","id":"2"},"issuetype":{"self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issuetype/6","id":"6","description":"A big user story that needs to be broken down.","iconUrl":"https://jira.cxense.com/download/resources/com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:greenhopper-webactions/images/ico_epic.png","name":"Epic","subtask":false}}}},{"id":"25421","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issueLink/25421","type":{"id":"10003","name":"Blocks","inward":"is blocked by","outward":"blocks","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issueLinkType/10003"},"outwardIssue":{"id":"36346","key":"CXANA-4870","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issue/36346","fields":{"summary":"Support lts/dmp cross site filter/aggregation per customer","status":{"self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/status/1","description":"The issue is open and ready for the assignee to start work on it.","iconUrl":"https://jira.cxense.com/images/icons/statuses/open.png","name":"Open","id":"1"},"priority":{"self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/priority/4","iconUrl":"https://jira.cxense.com/images/icons/priorities/minor.png","name":"Standard","id":"4"},"issuetype":{"self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issuetype/6","id":"6","description":"A big user story that needs to be broken down.","iconUrl":"https://jira.cxense.com/download/resources/com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:greenhopper-webactions/images/ico_epic.png","name":"Epic","subtask":false}}}},{"id":"26190","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issueLink/26190","type":{"id":"10003","name":"Blocks","inward":"is blocked by","outward":"blocks","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issueLinkType/10003"},"outwardIssue":{"id":"32304","key":"CXANA-4014","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issue/32304","fields":{"summary":"New feature:  Cross-site UU metrics for LTS cubes","status":{"self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/status/5","description":"A resolution has been taken, and it is awaiting verification by reporter.

The dictionary has been created for English based on best practices, and has been translated to a number of languages. We deploy this taxonomy to site groups upon demand (from onboarding, or the customer themselves). However, we do not have any way of ensuring that updates to the master dictionaries will be re-deployed to site groups using the relevant dictionaries. The standard taxonomy is deployed in the _-categories_ namespace, and will be processed as long term user interests in the user profile. Confusion as to which dictionaries/taxonomies are active for a site group is reflected by a large number of support/onboarding issues.\r\n\r\nIn order to simplify and improve deployment/maintenance of the standard taxonomy, we suggest that the standard taxonomy is enabled through the sitegroup configuration. This configuration should be admin only.

As we all now, no test can fully cover all the fun corner-cases of real production traffic. It also means that we have no way of testing the code before it merges, or see the code lie bfore it is really hit by customers. Since rolling back a cube is something that can take a few hours (snapshot and refeed, or restart and longer period of snapshot), this can be annoying to do in a safe way to avoid issues for customers.\r\n\r\nWe currently have several challenges around this:\r\n1) The restart happens infrequently, so possible \"hidden bombs\" can be deployed and run by accident due to a machine restart etc.\r\n2) There is no way to debug problems or performance issues without fiddling directly with production nodes.\r\n\r\nThis epic tries to cover part of problem 1, the hidden bombs, but major focus in on problem 2.\r\n\r\nThe suggested solution is to:\r\n(first 4 steps are just to set up something that is really a replica of a production cluster)\r\n1) Setup a separate new cube-cluster with the same number of nodes and a feeder.  This could be AWS or hetzner, more on that in the sub-task.\r\n2) Add a site-cube with local feeder, like in production\r\n3) Add a APIServer instance that only uses this cluster\r\n4) Add this node to the eventforwarders so that they get all event-traffic, as in production.\r\n\r\nThen, the special things:\r\n5) Add a customized snapshot-procedure that just does it as quickly as possible, and at a time of day where it is not useful for developers. \r\n6) Setup a job to mirror traffic to production to the test environment. \r\n7) (Optional) Consider canned data for replay\r\n8) Write logic to do auto-deploy of cubes. This is almost supported already, as the cubes can restart if an /internal/kill is sent to them. They will automatically refeed, so the only remainder is to add logic to auto-enable the cubes again after refeed (something we, by accident, also need for production).\r\n\r\nAn example use case is this week's production issues with historyFields. We seem to have solved the problem now, but we do not fully grasp why it is failing like it does. Issuing the killer queries to production is no longer possible (and not wanted :-) ), so the useful would be to have a separate cluster to do this kind of exploration and fixing, send the killer queries to an instrumented version of the cube, with the same data and the same traffic as normal production.. -> measure and find the solution.\r\n\r\nThis is also great to actually ensure we fix the problem.\r\n\r\nSince this is an investment in hardware and work hours, the backend developers should confirm that this is something they actually would benefit from.\r\n\r\nThe process of setting up the cluster should be done by someone else than Erik and Thorkild to spread knowledge about this to the rest of the team.\r\n\r\n\r\n","customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_10040":null,"customfield_10658":null,"issuelinks":[],"customfield_10659":null,"customfield_10656":null,"customfield_10657":null,"customfield_10654":null,"customfield_10655":null,"customfield_10000":null,"subtasks":[{"id":"28759","key":"CXANA-3068","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issue/28759","fields":{"summary":"Get sign-off that this is a prioritized matter","status":{"self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/status/6","description":"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

of probabilistic cross device mapping is an issue in several DMP sales efforts. We should evaluate whether we can implement a simple solution to cover basic scenarios.\r\n\r\nBrain dump. Split into multiple tickets as appropriate.\r\n\r\nToday we keep a gigantic mapping server-side that maps multiple user identifiers to a \"global identifier\". When combined with customer-supplied external identifiers (login handles or hashes thereof, typically) this mapping enables cross-device user identification.\r\n\r\nSuch a \"deterministic\" linking is typically the most reliable, but several of our competitors in the DMP space are boasting about also using various statistical algorithms for inferring that multiple devices are used by the same person. May or may not be marketing-speak, but we should also have some kind of story on this.\r\n\r\nAlthough the approach might be frought with some practical problems (e.g., see below), this seems like a decent fit for a data mining job in our offline processing framework (or some similar setup.)\r\n\r\nHere's a relevant article where Krux, a competitor of ours, discuss this approach:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.adexchanger.com/data-exchanges/the-cross-device-question-krux/\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\nVAIDYA: To add to what Tom said, in terms of data signatures we track, we use the IP address, the user’s device signature, their browsing patterns, where they browsed from, all of these different elements go into the [statistical] model. The model ends up computing a score that looks through cookies and says the similarity score between these two cookies is X. If X is past a certain threshold, we determine that those two cookies represent the same user across multiple
