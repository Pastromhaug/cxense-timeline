Placeholders can have a substantial impact on performance and hardware requirements, so we will introduce support for specific fields over time in a controlled fashion to avoid operational issues. \r\n\r\nInitially, we want to support the ability to submit key-values from a content widget tag to be replaced in the content configuration \"query\" and \"filter\" fields.\r\n\r\nA placeholder has the general syntax:\t\r\n{code}\r\n{<source>:<key>|<default>}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n* The <source> field defines where <key> comes from. Initially, we will support \"parameter\" (values coming from the widget tag). Later, we will introduce “content” for values from the content profile, “user” for values from the user profile, and “event” for value from the current event, but this is not part of this ticket.\r\n* The <key> field defines the key we use for the replacement, i.e., the placeholder is replaced with the value associated with <key>.\r\n* The symbols {noformat} { } : | {noformat} cannot appear in <source>, <key> or <default>.\r\n* The <default> value kicks in if the <source>:<key> for some reason is invalid or otherwise cannot be evaluated.\r\n* There can be multiple placeholders in the same query or filter field\r\n\r\nExample: \r\n{code}\r\n\"filter\": \"filter(category:\\\"{parameter:productcategory|electronics}\\\")\"\r\n\"query\": \"query(title:\\\"{parameter:userquery|*}\\\")\"\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThese placeholders will be supported for the type \"recs\" with matching modes: \"trend\", \"contextual\", \"behavioral\", \"collabctx\", \"collabusr\", and \"explicit\"\r\n\r\nThe placeholder key-values are submitted from the widget tag using the context object, see example below:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n{ context: {

The toolbar collects every page visit on the browser (not only the Rakuten site, but *any* sites).\r\nRakuten would like to feed these events to Cxense offline (perhaps daily basis) -- supposedly the data contains the Rakuten userid, visited URLs, queries made on the browser, and time stamp of each event.\r\nThey will then create segments based on the events; e.g. \"users who visited site A during the last X days\", or \"users who made queries for this specific term\".\r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy their requirements, we need the following:\r\n\r\n# ability (API) to send offline PV events in batches, respecting timestamp of the events\r\n# ability to filter traffic using filters like this: \"http://www.example.com/foo/bar/*\" -- the segments they would like to create will be based on such queries. Since we wouldn't be crawling the pages, content profile based filters like category/taxonomy wouldn't work.\r\n\r\n(I've created a separate ticket for the second requirement (CXANA-5586). This ticket should address the first requirement only).\r\n\r\nThe estimated number of events to be pushed is 800 million per month. Also note that they would like to do an initial feed of the last 6 months worth of data.\r\n\r\nI have had a brief discussion on (part of) this topic on cx-nuggets a while back:\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/a/cxense.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/cx-nuggets/4zyFvJZayVc/zjDEp4h2EQAJ\r\n\r\nNote: Use of DMP event was considered for this purpose but URLs would be too long for event parameter (the parameter length is limited to 20 chars).","customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10040":["InitialTriageNeedMoreInfo"],"customfield_10658":null,"customfield_10659":null,"issuelinks":[{"id":"27802","self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/issueLink/27802","type":{"id":"10001","name":"Related","inward":"is

was in the beginning two completly static views and has since been patched and modified to add functionality. This is mainly been done by adding support for user flexibility using the same building blocks that were created in the beginning. This has for the most part been a success story but we are now seeing the \"final\" limitations of the code. We see this primarily in two places.\r\n\r\n1. It is very difficult to create widgets that have non-trivial, multiple request (possibly with inter query dependencies). Evidence of this is the amount of time it took to create the Segment widget, Funnel Widget and Document widget. Creating more of these complex widgets won't take any less time if the building blocks aren't changed.\r\n2. Complex widgets, large workspaces are slow. The root cause of this is that there is a lot of stuff happening in the background (like network request state change) that will result on a complete re-render of the widget/workspaces. This is an expensive operation with our current libraries.\r\n\r\nA further (smaller) issue is that the API cache is tied to the workspace/view. This means that if you navigate from view A -> B -> A you will have to do the requests for A twice, even though the first requests are still valid. \r\n\r\nSollution:\r\nDo a complete rewrite of Workspaces using modern tools (the same tools used to create most of the DMP app).","customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_10040":["Dev-2016-H2","technical_roadmap"],"customfield_10658":null,"issuelinks":[],"customfield_10659":null,"customfield_10656":null,"customfield_10657":null,"customfield_10654":null,"customfield_10655":null,"customfield_10000":null,"subtasks":[],"status":{"self":"https://jira.cxense.com/rest/api/2/status/1","description":"The

no longer want to use cassandra, and this epic deals with removing the analytics cassandra.\r\n\r\n1. We need postgresql running with at least 3 postgresql replicas in each DC.A single postgresql master with manual failover is fine, but master downtime must not bring down any read-only replicas.\r\n2. Set up analytics to write both to cassandra and postgresql.\r\n3. Run with both cassandra and postgresql for a time, until we are sure postgresql has correct data.\r\n4. Start reading from postgresql instead of cassandra. This must only be done once postgresql is setup for comparable or better availability than cassandra. See INFRA-444 for details.\r\n5. Once all processes has been running stable long enough on top of postgresql, we can remove writes to cassandra.\r\n6. Remove cassandra\r\n7. Start taking advantage of SQL/postgresql\r\n\r\nUntil the last point, we should aim to have a simple postgresql schema, which can be used by CassandraKeyValueStore. Once we have removed cassandra, we can start to update or replace the code to get a more sane way of dealing with the database.\r\n\r\nPlease not that this epic will only require a minimal solution necessary to replace cassandra with postgresql.

to [Facebook documentation|https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/opengraph/object-type/article], publishers should populate the article:author meta tag in their pages with a URL to the author's Facebook page. \r\n\r\nAs such, we have customers building their pages with tags like this:\r\n{code}\r\n<meta property=\"article:author\" content=\"https://www.facebook.com/heygregr\" />\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nAnd we are then storing the URL as the \"author\" in our content profile for the page:\r\n{code}\r\n$ python cx.py /document/search '{\"siteIds\":[\"1145186158190231305\"],\"query\":\"query(url:\\\"http://www.1077theend.com/blogs/gregr/i-went-reptile-zoo-monroe\\\")\"}'\r\n{\r\n  \"totalCount\": 1, \r\n  \"matches\": [\r\n

support this FB functionality while also giving us the ability to store an actual author name instead of a URL, we need a prioritized meta field (such as {{cXenseParse:author}}) that will be used in
